# Skills

Skills are folders of instructions, scripts, and resources that agents can use to perform specialized tasks.

# About This Repository

This is the offical repository for all kaggle related skills.

# Creating a Basic Skill

Skills are simple to create - just a folder with a `SKILL.md` file containing YAML frontmatter and instructions. You can use the **template-skill** in this repository as a starting point:

```markdown
---
name: my-skill-name
description: A clear description of what this skill does and when to use it
---

# My Skill Name

[Add your instructions here that Claude will follow when this skill is active]

## Examples
- Example usage 1
- Example usage 2

## Guidelines
- Guideline 1
- Guideline 2
```

The frontmatter requires only two fields:
- `name` - A unique identifier for your skill (lowercase, hyphens for spaces)
- `description` - A complete description of what the skill does and when to use it
